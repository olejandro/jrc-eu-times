Scenarios and JRC publications
------------------------------
In-house scenarios have been developed with the JRC-EU-TIMES model to explore energy prospects within the EU.
More information about the scenario design can be found in JRC publications.
However, this most recent versions of scenarios may differ in following dimensions:
-calibration of existing stock, now linked to JRC-IDEES database
-the 2030 targets
-level of energy related CO2 emissions in 2050, now 100% reduction
-the sales of EV/PHEV, now with less restricting limits in the Zero Carbon scenarios.

Common assumptions
------------------
-The scenarios are aligned with following inputs of the Reference Scenario 2016 in the long run, up to 2050:
	oEnergy services demand or demand growth
	oFuel prices
	oBuilding stock projection

-Targets summary for 2030:
CO2: 	-40% compared to 1990
RES: 	>32%
EE: 	>32.5% implemented as Gross inland consumption < 1395 Mtoe, as in Baseline LTS, nov 2018
ETS: 	-47% CO2 compared to 2005, as in Baseline LTS, nov 2018
ESD: 	-30% CO2 compared to 2005 for transport, buildings, agriculture and waste, Effort Sharing legislation

-Targets summary for 2050:
EE: 	<1492 Mtoe Gross inland consumption, as in REF2016
ETS: 	<718 Mton CO2, as in Baseline LTS, nov 2018

-Energy Efficiency efforts in 2030: a 32.5% reduction of primary energy consumption from the projections for the year 2030 
compared to the 2007 baseline scenario (a 32.5% reduction from 1887 Mtoe). This is done by limiting the level 
of gross inland consumption in 2030 to 1386 Mtoe (result of EUCO3232.5). 
Gross inland consumption is higher than the primary energy because it also includes the non-energy uses.
-Renewable energy sources target minimum 32% of final energy consumption.
-ESD MS specific "targets" from proposal COM 2016/482. 
This is different from the outputs of the EUCO30 scenario where there is a cost optimal MS effort sharing.
-CCUS technologies enter the market not before 2030
-CCU (Carbon Utilisation) technologies are allowed, the main of which is the 
production of diesel/kerosene by combining hydrogen and CO2.
-Geological (underground) CO2 storage is only possible in some countries, in line with [1], 

Nuclear assumptions
-------------------
The  nuclear  fleet,  including  the  replacement  of  plants  due  for  retirement,  is  modelled  on  its 
economic  merit  and  in  competition  with  other  energy  sources  for  power  generation  except  for 
Member States with legislative provisions on nuclear phase out. Several constraints are put on the 
model  such  as  decisions  of  Member  States  not  to  use  nuclear  at  all  (Austria,  Cyprus,  Denmark, 
Estonia, Greece, Ireland, Latvia, Luxembourg, Malta and Portugal) and closure of existing plants in 
some  Member  States  according  to  agreed  schedules  (e.g.  Germany).  Nuclear  investments  are 
possible in all the other countries. In France, the total nuclear capacity is limited to 65GW, 
in Spain to 8GW and in Sweden to 9.4GW.
JRC-EU-TIMES has the option to extend the lifetime of existing nuclear power plants up to 60 years 
in the countries without a phase-out policy.

01_Baseline
-----------
It is a "business-as-usual" scenario which does not envision any dedicated efforts aimed at 
stabilising the atmospheric concentration of GHGs. In this scenario, the EU is assumed 
to reduce its energy-related CO2 emissions by 47% by 2050 with respect to 1990, as in the EU Reference Scenario 2016.
It is the only scenario with non-elastic demand. In a baseline scenario, users have to make sure that
the important drivers of the model (demand, EE, RES, CO2) are consistent.
Objective function: 75 101 674

02_Zero_Carbon
--------------
This scenario achieves 100 % CO2 reduction by 2050.
It limits the underground CO2 storage to 300 Mt/year, however CCU is unlimited.
In terms of scenario design, the Net-Zero is comparable to the scenario EC 2050 LTS 1.5TECH.
Up to 2020 fixed to the baseline and elastic demand with reference prices from the baseline.
Objective function: 85 982 820

03_Zero_Carbon_HighCCS
----------------------
This scenario is exactly the same as the Zero_Carbon, however 
the underground CO2 storage can be up to 1000 Mt/year.
In a world with less deployment of renewables, also the techno-economic
parameters are different.
"Solution available but not proven optimal due to numerical difficulties."
We could not identify a major non-optimality, especially given that we run without crossover.
The solution is useful for EU wide energy system analysis.
Objective function: 80 769 539
