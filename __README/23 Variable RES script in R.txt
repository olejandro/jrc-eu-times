JRC-EU-TIMES estimates negative residual loads (power surpluses) endogenously based on 
the amount of VRE and demand within each of the 12 timeslices of the model. The equations that are used 
for this estimation divides each timeslice in two sub-periods: one with and one without surplus. 
These surpluses can be transformed into hydrogen for direct uses or into e-fuels. 
These equations are based on a country-specific analysis with an hourly model 
outside JRC-EU-TIMES that includes hundreds of possible combinations of wind and solar capacities, 
using EMHIRES data, based on 30 years of meteodata. For this parametrization, it is assumed that 
each country has a storage capacity equal to 5 hours of average power demand which is equivalent 
to 40% of the full storage capacity if all cars would have a 30kWh battery. 

One result of the statistical analysis was that in each country, the error of parametrising 
the average surplus is smaller than the annual variations of the surpluses.
