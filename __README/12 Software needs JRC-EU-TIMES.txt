This file explains the software needs.

A TIMES model consists of two parts: (1) the TIMES database and (2) the ETSAP TIMES model generator or code. 
The JRC-EU-TIMES database is open and contains data that are numeric parameters and 
logic that are equations (relations) between different variables of the model that are not included in the ETSAP TIMES code. 
The TIMES code is owned by ETSAP and is provided free of charge to anyone that signs an ETSAP letter of agreement. 
The ETSAP TIMES code is not considered open source because it cannot be redistributed freely.

To use the ETSAP TIMES code, third party software is required such as GAMS. 
TIMES models are formulated in the algebraic modelling language GAMS. 
The actual solution of the optimisation problem requires a numerical solver. 
The JRC-EU-TIMES model is formulated as a linear programme and solved using CPLEX.
