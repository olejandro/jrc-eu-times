Emissions in JRC-EU-TIMES
-------------------------
JRC-EU-TIMES was designed to include CO2 and other emissions from energy related activities.
It includes now data for energy related CO2 only.

The total net emitted CO2 can be calculated as:
Var_comNet TOTCO2 = RSDCO2N + COMCO2N + AGRCO2N + SE_TRACO2N + INDCO2N + INDCO2P + ELCCO2N + SUPCO2N
For now, the model does not include investment related CO2 (ELCCO2I), ELCCO2P or SUPCO2P

CCUS
----
Total captured emissions are:
SNKCO2N = ELCSCO2N + INDSCO2N + SUPSCO2N + atmpospheric CO2 captured from TOTCO2
ELSCO2N, INDSCO2N and SUPSCO2N can be from a fossil or biogenic source.

SNKCO2N can be traded, can go to "sinks" (permanent underground storage) or be transformed into SINKCCU.
SNKCO2N = sum of all MINSNK* activities + SNKCCU.

SNKCCU can be the used to produce OILKER, OILDSL, OILGSL or OILNAP.
These are again used as final energy in all sectors, becomes again xxxCO2N, except for OILNAP that is a non-energy use.

The total CO2 produced can be calculated as:
= Var_FOut TOTCO2 + ELCSCO2N + INDSCO2N + SUPSCO2N

EXAMPLE OF CO2 results from the run "JRC-EU-TIMES 02_LCEO_Net-Zero_Carbon"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Total captured CO2 = 621 Mton (DAC = 370 Mton, from biomass = 251 Mton)
out of which permanently stored = MINSNK* = 300 Mton (limit)
out of which is reused as energy fuel = 225 Mton
out of which is stored as material (or non energy use) = 96 Mton

CO2 from use of fossil = 171 Mton
CO2 from biomass without capturing = 672 Mton

PROCESS EMISSIONS FROM INDUSTRY
-------------------------------
INDCO2P are "aggregated" to ETSCO2 with COMAGG.
This means that the sum of INDCO2P emissions is added to the ETSCO2 group.
INDCO2P emissions are visible as a total, as part of ETSCO2 under the process "-" 

COMMODITIES THAT ARE NOT USED
-----------------------------
SE_xxxCO2N other than SE_TRACO2N are not useful.
SE_TRACO2N should be used and not TRACO2N.
TRACO2N is only useful to estimate the emissions from vehicles, but mind biofuels are included.
